## {{projectName}}

Run `kubernate hello-world`.

This example uses Kubernate to create a namespace, a pod template and a deployment for every demo/v1/HelloWorld you create. The outputs are written to a single yaml file in `output/hello-world.yaml`.

If you update the spec of the resource, make sure to run `kubernate generate` to update the generated code.
